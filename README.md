# MediminderPatientVersionPrototype
Prototype for patient version of mediminder app for Dr. Bullard's Principles of Software Engineering class

Hey guys, so first Bryce will build the UI for this, then Gil will write the necessary activity classes 
and hook them up to the UI, then Francky will write the business logic. It will be more clear as we go along,
let's just start with Bryce doing the UI.

To clone this repo first make sure you have git installed, then
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/mddrill/MediminderPatientVersionPrototype/
```

This will clone this project to your home directory.
Next download Android Studio and open this project, then do your part.

When you done doing your part do
```
git add .
git commit -m "did <your-name>s part"
git push origin master
```
That will update this github repo with the changes you made

Don't hesistate to ask me questions if this isn't clear enough.

Here are the UI drawings
